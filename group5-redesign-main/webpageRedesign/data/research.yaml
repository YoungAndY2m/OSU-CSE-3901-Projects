research: 
  - {title: "Variation-Aware Microprocessor Design",
    information: "Manufacturing process challenges have caused variation in transistor characteristics such as switching speed and power 
      consumption. Process variation together with temperature and voltage variations (generally referred to as parameter variations) 
      are having an increasingly detrimental effect on current and future generations of microprocessors, resulting in lower chip 
      frequency, higher power consumption and decreased reliability.
      We investigate architectures that incorporate variation-awareness in the design process as well as in runtime adaptation 
      and optimization solutions designed to achieve better reliability and energy efficiency in increasingly unpredictable systems."}
  - {title: "Ultra-low Power Multicore Architectures",
    information: "Power management in chip multiprocessors continues to be one of the primary concerns for chip designers. With future multicores 
    expected to have dozens or even hundreds of cores on a single die power demands will far exceed what is safe to deliver to the chip 
    and practical to dissipate with standard cooling methods. Drastic solutions are needed to ensure future microprocessors will not 
    hit a power wall that will prevent them from taking full advantage of technology scaling.      Our lab is developing solutions for enabling ultra-low voltage operation of multicore chips in an effort to dramatically 
    improve energy efficiency of computation."}
  - {title: "Architectural Solutions for Software Reliability",
    information: "Software is growing in complexity and becoming increasingly prone to design and implementation errors. Given the current 
    wide-spread adoption of chip multiprocessors, this problem is only getting worse. Parallel applications are especially hard 
    to write and debug, being prone to nondeterministic synchronization bugs such as data races.
    In this project we investigate architectural solutions for making the software more robust by providing software-controlled 
    hardware primitives that enable efficient runtime monitoring and debugging solutions."}
